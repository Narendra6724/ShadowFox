This repository contains my submission for the Shadowfox Beginners Level Task, focusing on data visualization in Python using Pandas and Seaborn.
The documentation explains the concepts, features, example implementations, and comparison of these two popular libraries.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

Data visualization is an essential part of data analysis.
This project explores:

Pandas: A versatile data analysis library with built-in plotting for quick insights.

Seaborn: A high-level visualization library built on Matplotlib for creating attractive, statistical graphics.

The documentation provides:

>Introduction to both libraries

>Key features and plotting capabilities

>Example code snippets

>Comparison of Pandas and Seaborn
