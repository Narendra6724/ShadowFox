# 🌫️☁️ Delhi Air Quality Index (AQI) Explorer  

## 📍 Project Overview  
This project is part of the **ShadowFox Internship – Level 2**, where I developed an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** to analyze the **Air Quality Index (AQI) in Delhi**.  

The dashboard helps explore:  
- Pollutant trends  
- Seasonal variations  
- Correlations  
- NLP insights from text columns (optional)  
- Environmental drivers  

✅ All in a **dark-themed UI**.

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Build an interactive AQI dashboard for Delhi data  
- Analyze key pollutants: **PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, SO₂, O₃, CO, NH₃**  
- Identify seasonal variations in air quality  
- Assess **station-wise / location-wise** differences  
- Provide visualizations: **trends, boxplots, histograms, heatmaps, scatter plots**  
- Enable **WHO guideline exceedance analysis** via pie charts  
- Add optional **NLP-based insights** (keywords + sentiment from remarks/comments)

## 🤖 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Streamlit  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook (for initial analysis), Streamlit (for dashboard UI)

## ⚙️ Features in Dashboard  
- ✅ Upload CSVs dynamically (Delhi AQI datasets)  
- ✅ Dark-themed UI with custom CSS  
- ✅ 7-day rolling average trends for pollutants  
- ✅ Seasonal boxplots & monthly averages  
- ✅ Distribution histograms for pollutants  
- ✅ Correlation heatmaps  
- ✅ Scatter plots (select X vs Y pollutants)  
- ✅ Pie charts for WHO exceedance share  
- ✅ Environmental drivers analysis (AQI vs Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, etc.)  
- ✅ Optional NLP module for text columns – keywords + sentiment

## 📊 Sample Visualizations  
- 📈 Trend Analysis – 7-day rolling averages  
- 📦 Boxplots – seasonal distribution of pollutants  
- 🔥 Heatmaps – pollutant correlations  
- ✨ Scatter Plots – pollutant vs pollutant or pollutant vs drivers  
- 🥧 Pie Chart – WHO exceedance days

## 🔑 Key Insights from Delhi AQI Data  
- **PM2.5 and PM10** are the most critical pollutants impacting Delhi AQI  
- **Seasonality is strong** – winter months show peak AQI values  
- **Geographic hotspots** exist near industrial areas and high-traffic corridors  
- Many pollutants **regularly exceed WHO daily limits**  
- **NLP insights** (if comments/remarks are available) can highlight citizen concerns
